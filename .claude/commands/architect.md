# /architect

Enter Architect mode. Plan before implementing.

Read:
- `.agent/product_vision.md`
- `.agent/architecture.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`

Then output:
1. Which files need to be created or modified
2. The sequence of changes
3. Any questions or risks

**Do not write implementation code in this mode.**
