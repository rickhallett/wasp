# Spike Prompt

Intentionally vague. Used for creative exploration.

---

## When to Use

- Starting something new and you're not sure of the approach
- Want to see what the agent comes up with unprompted
- Exploring design space before committing

## The Prompt

> "Make this work. Surprise me with the approach."

Or:

> "Build [rough goal]. Don't ask clarifying questions — make your best guess and ship something I can react to."

## Why It Works

- Agent hallucinates solutions you wouldn't have thought of
- Wrong? Revert. Cheap.
- Right? Free creativity.

## After the Spike

Once you have something tangible:
1. React to it — what works, what doesn't
2. Refine the spec based on what you learned
3. Switch to `/weaver` mode for disciplined implementation

---

Treat the agent as a creative partner, not a typewriter.
