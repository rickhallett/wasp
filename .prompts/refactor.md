# Refactor Guidelines

When refactoring:

1. **Prioritize readability over brevity** — clever code is tech debt
2. **Create small, composable functions** — each does one thing
3. **Do not change behavior** — refactoring is not feature work
4. **Run the Gate before and after** — prove you didn't break anything
5. **Explain the "why"** — leave a brief note on what improved

If you're unsure whether a change is refactoring or a feature, ask first.
